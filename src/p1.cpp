/*
In this project, you will implement the tic-tac-toe game for a 3 by 3 square.
The game will be played by two players (players A and B).
All output are to the console. Follow these guidelines:

1)	Draw the board (ensure its nicely formatted as a square)
	after each move and make sure to prompt the user with enough information on what to input;
	if the user tries to use an occupied space, then he effectively loses his move (no redoes!);
	any illegal characters input also results in loss of the move (your implementation will check for all this).

2)	You are given the outline of the program that you can use to start the project.
	Make sure you test your implementation well against boundary cases, illegal input, etc.

3)	Turn in your source file to Canvas by the deadline.
	There will be no extensions or late credit.
